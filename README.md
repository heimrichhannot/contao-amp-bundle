# Contao AMP Bundle

This bundle offers functionality concerning \"Accelerated Mobile Pages\" (AMP) for the Contao CMS.

## Features

- offer an alternative AMP version for an ordinary Contao page (GET-Parameter `amp=1` must be set)
- offer AMP templates for the supported content elements

## Installation

Install via composer: `composer require heimrichhannot/contao-amp-bundle` and update your database.

## Configuration

1. Create an ordinary layout and assign `fe_page_amp.html5` as template. Don't click `Add AMP support` here, we'll do that in the next step ;-)
2. Navigate to your existing layout or create a new one for the page that should support both AMP and non-AMP. Click `Add AMP support` and choose the layout we just created in step 1.
3. Assign the layout created in step 2 to your page.
4. In order to show your website in AMP mode simply append the GET parameter `amp=1` to your URL, i.e. `https://www.example.org/article` -> `https://www.example.org/article?amp=1`

## Things to know

### Meta-Tag handling in fe_page

The meta tags are handled using [heimrichhannot/contao-head-bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-head-bundle) and rendered as follows:

```
<?php $this->block('meta'); ?>
    <?= $this->meta; ?>
<?php $this->endblock(); ?>
```

### Responsive images Contao vs. AMP

Keep in mind: If you didn't specify image sizes in Contao, you can skip this chapter.

In Contao responsive images are built with "archives" (`tl_image_size` and `tl_image_size_item`). In tl_image_size you can define a default
image size and in `tl_image_size_item` instances more sizes depending on a given media query.

In AMP on the other hand there's no such thing as a default case, so you need to create it **explicitly**. Also you have to add media-queries for
each and every `tl_image_size_item` so that you don't have duplicates.

So you have 2 options:

1. Assign an image size with **no** child elements to your image, i.e. only `tl_image_size`.
2. Create `tl_image_size_item` instances so that you have one for every situation that can happen. Example:
