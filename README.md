### AMP Validation

You can validate your AMP page by appending `#development=1` to your url.

Things to consider:

- If you do that in dev mode (by using `app_dev.php`), you'll get validation errors concerning the position of custom CSS tag and that custom JS is not allowed. Both of the errors are due to the symfony debug toolbar and should disappear in production mode.
- When developing a website you might do that in localhost or some kind of custom domain. So you can ignore the error "The attribute 'href' in tag 'base' is set to the invalid value [...]" becuase in production mode it will disappear.
- Take care of your generated CSS: it shouldn't contain any source map files, because these will significantly increase the size of the CSS

### Meta-Tag handling in fe_page

The meta tags are handled using [heimrichhannot/contao-head-bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-head-bundle) and rendered as follows:

```
<?php $this->block('meta'); ?>
    <?= $this->meta; ?>
<?php $this->endblock(); ?>
```

*Hint: If you use `fe_page_amp.html5` in your AMP layout, you won't have to take care of this.*

### Override templates

#### HTML5 templates

These can be overridden as usual by putting a file with the same name into your project's `templates` directory or in the `templates` directory of one of your modules.

#### Twig templates

These can be overridden by putting a file with the same name into your project's `app/Resources/views` directory or in the `src/Resources/views` directory of one of
your bundles (these bundles must load after the `contao-amp-bundle`; you can specify this in your bundle's `Plugin.php`).

### Responsive images: Contao vs. AMP

Keep in mind: If you didn't specify image sizes in Contao, you can skip this chapter.

In Contao responsive images are built with "archives" (`tl_image_size` and `tl_image_size_item`). In tl_image_size you can define a default
image size and in `tl_image_size_item` instances more sizes depending on a given media query.

In AMP on the other hand there's no such thing as a default case, so you need to create it **explicitly**. Also you have to add media-queries for
each and every `tl_image_size_item` so that you don't have duplicates.

So you have 2 options:

1. Assign an image size with **no** child elements to your image, i.e. only `tl_image_size`.
2. Create `tl_image_size_item` instances so that you have one for every situation that can happen. Example:

![alt text](docs/image-sizes.png)

### SVG images

If you use svg-images ensure that they have assigned `width` and `height` attributes on the `<svg>` element. Otherwise they wont have dimensions in their amp-version and the lazy loading component requires width and height for aspect ratio padding.

For non-amp version simply add the following css rules and attach `.img-fluid` css class to make svg responsive again:

```
.img-fluid {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```

### Usage with heimrichhannot/contao-encore-bundle

This bundle supports the integration of webpack encore using [heimrichhannot/contao-encore-bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-encore-bundle).

For this you can simply add a new webpack entry in your `config.yml` as you would normally within `contao-encore-bundle` and assign it to your AMP layout.

The code in the generated file then automatically gets rendered to the `<style amp-custom>` element. Simple as that :-)

## Known limitations

- currently AMP pages without a non-AMP layout are not supported
